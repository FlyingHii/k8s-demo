# Node.js Express App

This is a simple Node.js application built with Express. It serves a "Hello, Kubernetes!" message on the root path.

## Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm installed on your machine
*   Docker installed (for building and running the container)
*   kubectl (for deploying to Kubernetes, if applicable)

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2.  **Build the Docker image:**

    ```bash
    docker build -t node-app .
    ```

3.  **Run the Docker container:**

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:8080 node-app
    ```

    This will start the application and make it accessible on `http://localhost:8080`.

4.  **(Optional) Deploy to Kubernetes:**
    *   Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster running and `kubectl` configured to connect to it.
        *   **Local Development:** If you're developing locally, you can use tools like Minikube or Docker Desktop (which includes a Kubernetes cluster).  Start Minikube with `minikube start` or ensure Kubernetes is enabled in Docker Desktop settings.
        *   **Cloud Providers:** If you're using a cloud provider (like Google Kubernetes Engine, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, or Azure Kubernetes Service), you'll need to:
            *   Create a Kubernetes cluster in your cloud provider's console.
            *   Install the cloud provider's CLI (e.g., `gcloud` for GKE, `aws` for EKS, `az` for AKS).
            *   Configure `kubectl` to connect to your cluster using the cloud provider's instructions (usually involving downloading a configuration file or running a command to set up the context).
    *   Create a deployment and service using the provided Kubernetes configuration files (e.g., `k8s/deployment.yaml` and `k8s/service.yaml`).  *Note: You will need to create these files if they don't exist.*
    *   Deploy the application:
        ```bash
        kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
        kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
        ```
    *   Access the application through the service's external IP or hostname.
    *   **Access the application using k9s:** If you have `k9s` installed and configured to connect to your Kubernetes cluster, you can use it to view and manage your deployment. Run `k9s` in your terminal and navigate to the `pods` or `services` view to see your application.
    *   **Set the Kubernetes namespace:** If you want to deploy to a specific namespace, set the context:
        ```bash
        kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=<namespace-name>
        ```

## Project Structure

*   `main.js`: The main application file (Node.js with Express).
*   `package.json`:  Defines the project's dependencies and scripts.
*   `Dockerfile`:  Instructions for building the Docker image.
*   `README.md`:  This file.
*   `k8s/deployment.yaml`: Kubernetes deployment configuration (example).
*   `k8s/service.yaml`: Kubernetes service configuration (example).
*   `.dockerignore`:  Specifies files and directories to exclude when building the Docker image.
*   `.gitignore`:  Specifies files and directories to exclude from Git version control.
